# week 2
- the first week wasn't journaled but i basically created the backend using java springboot and I did the APIs, now i have them waiting to connect. I also managed to create the frontend with react, JSX, which is like react saying just write your javascript and we will handle the rendering.
- today i got the react router to work, fixed an issue as the way you load your routes changes from using `component={home}` to `element={<Home />}`. I had to figure that out myself using the react--route doc.
- I need to get the .fetch() working by the week.
- I decided to journal since i don't want to forget what i know, more specifically be able to talk about things i have done.
