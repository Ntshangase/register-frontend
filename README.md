# Register Application
- I want to be improve my fullstack prowess and to do that I'm building a full stack application which i will use `java` for backend and `javascript` for frontend.
- I wanted to build a simple application which i will always understand it's functions but in it's  implimentation i will also be challenged.

## Backend 
- JAVA
- Spring-Boot using the spring initiailizer
- I used jackoson dependancy to serialize my data into `JSON` format
## frontend 
- JAVASCRIPT
- React using create react app

### Functionalities
- Backend + Frontend communication through `REST APIs`
